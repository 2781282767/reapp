## Upgrading Reapp

**If you haven't customized your app much, it may be easier to just create a new reapp
folder and copy in your changes**

### 0.7

For 0.7 we've added iOS builds. Our build system already supported multiple builds though
the use of [multiple build files](https://github.com/reapp/reapp#custom-builds), but it
didn't support multiple layout.html files for each build. We've added this support.
